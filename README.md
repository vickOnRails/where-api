# Where API

WhereAPI is a self-hosted, open source, RESTful service to help solve location-related functionality for African applications.

> WhereAPI is an experiment and I'm currently talking to users and building additional features on demand. It's not ready for production, please take a look at the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/93xAfnnT/where-api-tracker) to see progress. However, you can [create an account](https://www.whereapi.xyz/auth/sign-up) to experiment with the API as a Beta tester.

## Project Purpose

While working at a startup in 2017, there was one problem that really bothered us - Location. We spent weeks trying to collate and index a database of 32 states with their Local govt areas. Some had 12, some had 17, one had 44.

At my second job, we had to seed, maintain and constantly update a database of the same exact information - Countries, States and LGAs. This took a lot of time from actually building software.

This is why Iâ€™m building Where API - **To help solve location-related problems for African developers.**
